# simpleBlog

A basic blog application made with Node + express + Mongo + React made as an exercise for my Web Development Class.

## Organization

The root folder contains a basic express application generated with express-generator. The public folder contains a basic frontend built with jade as a demonstration, but the final frontend was created with create-react-app and resides in the front folder. Notice that the front folder is a whole different project.

## Developing

Start the server, you can test it on https://localhost:3001

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Start the client, you can test it on https://localhost:3000. Use this URL for development, as react has been configured to connect to the backend on 3001 when doing AJAX.

```
cd front
yarn install
yarn start
```

Have an instance of mongo running, and set the mongo url to the MONGO_URL environment variable. If not variable is found then mongodb://localhost:27017 will be used.

## Preparing for deployment

```
yarn install
cd front
yarn install
yarn run build
cd ..
yarn start
```

## Deploying to Heroku

_. Follow carefully the steps here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs
_. Create a free account in mongo atlas, start a new cluster.
_. Make sure that you create a new user in mongo atlas with permissions to edit the database.
_. Make sure that you whitelist your ip for connecting to the database
